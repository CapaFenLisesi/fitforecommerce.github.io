      <p>Germany-based Handelsjournal estimated in 2015 that the market share of online shops in Germany will almost double from currently 8.5 % to about 15 % in the year 2025. This development makes it clear that companies are in need for specialists in the field of e-commerce. Up to now there are only very little training possibilities for young people in this field. The vocational schools Staatliche Berufsschule II Bayreuth, SPS el-it Dobruska and Landesberufsschule Tschuggmall Brixen (Scuola Professionale Provinciale Tschuggmall di Bressanone) have formed a strategic partnership in order to develop training concepts for this emerging sector and thus give students new employment and career opportunities.</p>

<p>The acclaimed objective of the project is to develop innovative, learner-centered, action-based materials which are designed to foster the digital competence of our students. This includes the following abilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>developing a spirit of entrepreneurship</li>
<li>setting up and administrating an online shop</li>
<li>processing orders and communicating with customers online</li>
<li><p>evaluating shop performance, calculating key figures (e.g. conversion rate)</p></li>
<li><p>monitoring and evaluating website traffic</p></li>
<li>planning and implementing (online) marketing for e-commerce including search engine optimisation</li>
<li><p>creating graphic designs and content for use in e-commerce</p></li>
<li><p>reading and interpreting HTML code of existing websites</p></li>
<li>coding a basic internet site in HTML and CSS</li>
<li>publishing HTML content to the web</li>
</ul>

<p>The materials will be thoroughly tested in three learning activities which will be hosted by the participating schools and then openly published to the project website. Furthermore a platform will be implemented in order to make the setup of multiple onlineshops for in-classroom use easy for teachers.</p>
