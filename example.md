# Markdown-Example - Source-Code

## Paragraphs
This is a regular paragraph, which will be displayed normally on the website. By adding two line breaks you start a new paragraph.

Within a paragraph there can be **bold text** and *italic text*. Alternatively you can mark __bold text__ and _italic text with underscores.

## Headlines
Headlines are marked with one or multiple hashes at the beginning of a line. One hash stands for a logical (sub-)level of the outline. Please remember to keep the outline of the document logical.
### Subheading 3
#### Subheading 4
##### Subheading 5

## Lists
There two types of lists. Ordered (beginning with an arabic number with a dot) and unordered lists (beginning with a - or *). An ordered list is automatically numbered by Markdown.
