Within our Erasmus+ project carried out by the vocational schools Kaufmännische Berufsschule Bayreuth (Germany), Scuola Professionale Provinciale Tschuggmall Brixen (South Tyrol) der SPSeli.it Dobruska (Czech Republic) the first visit of teachers and students took place in Bayreuth from 2 April 2017 until 7 April 2017.

On Sunday afternoon 10 students and 2 teachers from our partner schools in Brixen and Dobruska each arrived in Bayreuth and checked in in the HWK hostel in Bayreuth. We enjoyed dinner together with the partners and students got to know each other a little better.

Goal of the week was to let students work independently in mixed international groups on setting up their own online shops with the software Prestashop and the assistance of teaching material developed by the German teachers.

On Monday morning the headmaster OStD Bernhard Grünewald welcomed the guests together with 14 German students and the participating teachers OStR Kolb, OStRin Kolb, OStRin Stöcker, OStRin Wunderlich, StD Echtler and StR Dietl. At the beginning the students attended a short presentation about the vocational schoolsystem in Bavaria before they were shown around the schoolhouse.

After that the students got down to business and started working in their groups. They showed a lot of creativity in developing business ideas for their shops. The groups went on setting up the online shops on Tuesday by adding products, pictures and description of products. At noon the entire group attended a reception at the town hall or Bayreuth by deputy mayor Thomas Ebersberger.

On Wednesday Patrick Weinstein founder and managing director of Patworx GmbH, an acknowledged Prestashop expert spent the entire day with the students and gave insight in Prestashop and his work. He helped the groups setting up their shops, managed to solve more complex problems and gave useful tips.

The task for Thursday was to finish the shops and prepare a presentation about the shops, before the students had a tour at the brewery museum at Maisels brewery. In the evening the participating students and teachers enjoyed the farewell dinner at the restaurant Schinner Braustuben.
The final presentation of the shops to a bigger audience took place on Friday morning where other students from Kaufmännische Berufsschule Bayreuth where invited to see the respectable results of one week project work.

One week of project work passed very quickly so that the students left Bayreuth on Friday noon. But everyone is looking forward to seeing each other again in autumn 2018 in Brixen, when student will work on search engine optimization (SEO), website analytics and product photography.
