Our project now has its own webserver ready. You will find a copy of our website at these two addresses:

1. [https://fitforecommerce.eu](https://fitforecommerce.eu)
2. [https://fitforecommerce.github.io](https://fitforecommerce.github.io)

## Technical Specs
The server is hosted by German company [https://alfahosting.de](https://alfahosting.de). We chose their [CLOUD-SERVER M](https://alfahosting.de/vserver-hosting/) offering. Here are a few facts:

|-----------------------|-------------------|
|Processor cores		| 2 CPU vCores 		|
|RAM					| 2 Gigabyte		|
|HD space				| 150 GB SSD memory |
|Traffic				| unlimited			|
|Operating System		| Debian 8.0 / 64 bit |

## What the server will be used for
The server will host the project homepage and (even more important) be used for hosting the onlineshop platform. That means that there will be quite a few installation of online shops running on this server for the students of our [three participating schools](/about/index.html#the-partners).

Installing and hosting these shops is one of the planned outcomes of our project.
